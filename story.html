        Once upon a time in a magical village, two friendly wizards, Merlin and Luna, discovered a dusty old book on fraction magic. Excited to learn, they practised multiplying fractions of different denominators and found a spell to simplify them. As they mastered these skills, they faced challenges from mischievous imps who loved to mix up fractions. Can you help Merlin and Luna by answering?

        Merlin and Luna used their mastery of multiplying and simplifying fractions to create a powerful spell, restoring order to the village. The mischievous imps, realising they were defeated, fled in haste. Now free from chaos, the villagers celebrated Merlin and Luna as heroes. Peace and harmony returned, with everyone living happily ever after.
